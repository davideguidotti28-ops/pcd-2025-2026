### Multithreaded programming in Java: Performances, CPU vs. I/O bound programs

- [Lab Notes] Performance of Concurrent Programs 

- "concurrent sorting" exercise, example of CPU-intensive case - `pcd.lab02.ex01`
  - n-core solution: design
  - meausuring speed-up with different configurations (1, 2, 4, #cores, >#cores)

- From a CPU-bound to an IO-bound example: `pcd.lab02.io_bound_test`
  - executing the test (and measuring performance) with different configurations
    - pure CPU (with 1,2, #cores, >#cores)
    - CPU + I/O (with 1,2, #cores, >#cores)

- "bouncing balls" example
  - when sleeping could be useful...

- "How many threads" example: `pcd.lab02.how_many_threads`
  - about the limitations that we have with platform (OS) threads in Java
