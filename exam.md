# About the Exam
	
v1.0.0-20260215

The exam includes two parts: a (1) practical part and (2) an oral discussion. 

### Practical Part

The practical part concern the development of **assignments** proposed during the course, that are small projects about main parts
- There will be 4 assignments, one for each main part of the course.
- Assignments are announced during the course, but there are **no deadlines** for delivering them. 
- Assignments can be done either individually or in groups (max 3 persons – exceptions should be discussed).
- Assignments must be delivered within the day before the date planned for the oral discussion, that is: if you have the colloquium on day X, all three assignments should be available on the course web site since the day before X.
- About the evaluation: assignments are *not* partial exams, there is not a single evaluation for each one. They constitute the material used to structure the oral discussion, they are your portfolio about what you built with the course.
- Assignments do not expire.  

### Oral discussion

The oral discussion is both about the assignments and the key concepts and methods discussed during the course. 
- The discussion is **individual**.

### How to fix the date of the exam

In order to fix the date of the exam, you must send me (a.ricci@unibo.it) specifying the week in which they would like to have the oral exam and I will reply with a proposal about some specific slots.
- There will be no fixed dates on "AlmaEsami", the date will be decided by email.
